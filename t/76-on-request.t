# on_request: request interception through the in-process proxy.
#
# WebKitGTK 6.0 offers no mutable request hook of its own: the UI process has
# only the observational 'sent-request' (the mutable 'send-request' does not
# exist in 6.0 at all), and libsoup is unreachable because WebKit2 runs
# networking in a separate process. So interception happens where the plaintext
# actually is -- the MITM proxy this module already spins for
# network_fingerprint.
#
# WHY THIS TEST DOES NOT DRIVE A PAGE LOAD: WebKit bypasses the proxy for local
# addresses. Verified in both directions -- a page load to a 127.0.0.1 origin
# AND to a LAN address reaches the origin directly with the hook never firing,
# and the same is true of the long-proven network_fingerprint path, so it is
# WebKit's routing, not this wiring. Proving interception through a page load
# would therefore need an external host, i.e. real network traffic in the
# suite. Instead: the interception LOGIC is covered exhaustively by
# Proxy::Impersonate's own t/31-on-request.t (29 assertions, mutation-checked),
# and what is tested here is that EV::WebKit wires the hook into a live proxy
# -- by speaking to that proxy exactly as a client would.
