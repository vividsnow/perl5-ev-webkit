#    nested read can pull the outer call's response off the socket. Discarding it
#    leaves the outer caller waiting forever for an answer that already arrived.
#
#    Driven against a FAKE server: the bug needs BOTH responses to land in ONE
#    read, which is an interleaving a real server produces under load and which
#    a test cannot get by hoping for it. (No browser needed -- this is entirely
