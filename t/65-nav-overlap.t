# Regression coverage for "a stray navigation signal resolves the WRONG
# nav's callback": {pending} used to be a bare [cb, timer] with no identity,
# so when go(B) supersedes an in-flight go(A), WebKit's own cancellation of
# A's now-abandoned load surfaces later as a load-failed for A's uri -- and
# since {pending} already holds B's callback by the time it arrives, the OLD
# code resolved B's callback with A's cancellation error, silently dropping
# B's real completion (already consumed). See _start_nav/_finish_nav's
# generation + tracked-target-uri gating in lib/EV/WebKit.pm.

# --- 1) reentrant repro (100% deterministic, no timing dependency): the

#     before returning mock://a's own body. go(a)'s own in-flight load is
#     itself what gets superseded-then-cancelled, entirely synchronously
#     from Perl's point of view.

# --- 2) plain overlapping go()/go() -- the non-reentrant case (1) and (3)
#     cannot cover: an ordinary caller issuing a second go() while the first
#     is still loading. WebKit's cancellation of A's now-abandoned load
#     surfaces later as a load-failed for A's uri, by which time {pending}
#     already holds B.
#
#     The overlap is MANUFACTURED, not raced. Issuing go(B) from a short
#     EV::timer only tests anything when the timer beats the load, and stops
#     doing so as navigation gets faster -- silently, since the outcome is
#     asserted but never the premise. A server that withholds its response
#     makes A provably in flight on any machine, and the preconditions below
#     say so out loud instead of leaving it inferred from a passing result.
#
#     Two positions in A's lifecycle, since where the cancellation lands
#     relative to the commit is exactly what the gates disambiguate:
#       held  -- no response at all, so A is cancelled before committing
#       hdrs  -- headers sent, body withheld, so A is cancelled after it
#                commits and has a uri of its own

#     destination isn't known ahead of time, and load_html has none at all),
#     so the target-uri gate that protects go()-vs-go() above is inert for
#     these four -- see _start_nav's callers. Only the started-since gate
#     (a stray load-failed can't belong to a pending nav that has not yet
#     seen its own load-changed started/committed) protects them. Prime a
#     two-entry history (h1, h2) so back() has somewhere to go, then --
#     reentrantly, from inside mock://a's own producer, exactly like test
#     (1) above -- call back() before mock://a's own load settles. WebKit's
#     cancellation of the now-superseded mock://a load surfaces later as a

#     way than (3): confirmed live (5/5 trace runs), WebKit's reload() here
#     reloads the last-COMMITTED page (mock://h2 -- mock://a never
#     committed before being superseded), NOT the provisional mock://a uri
#     that get_uri() optimistically shows -- so reload()'s own pending has
#     an untracked target that doesn't even coincide with the superseded
#     nav's uri. Only "has MY pending seen its own started yet" can
#     identify the later stray load-failed (for mock://a) as not-mine; a
#     uri comparison would have nothing to key off at all. The final uri
#     is therefore intentionally not asserted here (it is an incidental
#     WebKit implementation detail, not part of this fix's contract) --
#     only that reload() resolves truthfully, without cross-talk.
