# 1) white-box regression: quit() during the settle window must not crash
#    reading a torn-down view -- and must still RESOLVE the nav callback.
#
#    _finish_nav deletes {pending} and only then hands the callback to the
#    settle timer, so for that ~30ms window it belongs to no registry. quit()
#    stops the timer (rightly -- it would report success on a torn-down browser
#    and touch a dead view), and the callback used to simply vanish: a go() that
#    succeeded and was quit() within the settle window never called back at all,
#    a silent hang for anyone awaiting it. Suppressing the SUCCESS delivery was
#    right; dropping the callback was not. It is now tracked, so quit()'s flush
#    resolves it exactly once with 'browser closed', like every other in-flight
#    op (see t/50-quit-flush.t), and the settle timer stays cancelled.
